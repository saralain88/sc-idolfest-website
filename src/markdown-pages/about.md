SoCal IdolFest is a passion project founded by experienced event organizers. Our goal is to create an event space where idol fans of all types can gather and share in the unique joy that idols bring to our lives. Whether youâ€™re a long-time wota or just getting into the scene, SCIF has a place for you!

Though our beginnings may be humble, our love for idols knows no bounds. With your help and under the guidance of our dedicated team, we hope to grow into an event that can bring you live guests from overseas. We aim to become the premiere US convention for the idol community!

Also, we're now about ducks. HONK!!

## The Chairs

**Lucas** (aka Mikotan) has been on the So Cal convention scene for over a decade and has been hosting and organizing events, including TouhouFest and AniMarketplace since 2019. He has extensive knowledge and experience in administration and finance and is glad to be spearheading this collaboration between AniMarketplace and NWIF!

**ashes** (*she/they*) fell in love with the world of Japanese idols at the ripe age of fifteen. Unable to perform herself, she decided to devote her life to supporting others living out their dreams in any way she could. When not running SoCal IdolFest or discovering independent idol groups with less than five monthly listeners on Spotify, she's one of the heads of Public Relations for the parent IdolFest organization.

## The Staff

Our all-volunteer staff is made up of veteran convention runners from all backgrounds and professions. We operate under a policy of transparency and long-term planning to bring the best possible experience to the Pacific Northwest.
